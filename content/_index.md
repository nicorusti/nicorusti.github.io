I'm an engineer of several trades based in Switzerland. I am currently leading the [SCION Association](https://scion.org/), where we develop the SCION protocol to provide secure and reliable connectivity for critical infrastructure ecosystems. I focus on fostering adoption, outreach and IETF specifications.

Previously, I was a research assistant in network security at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and technical account manager at [Open Systems](https://www.open-systems.com/).

My professional interests revolve around security, cloud computing, and networking, as well as finding business models for new ideas, technology transfer, and building communities. Feel free to get in touch!
