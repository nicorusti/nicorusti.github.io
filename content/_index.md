I'm an engineer of several trades based in Switzerland. I am currently a research assistant at the [Network Security Group](https://netsec.ethz.ch/) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).There, I work on making the Internet more secure and reliable with the [SCION](https://www.scion-architecture.net/) Architecture and help starting up the [SCION Foundation](https://www.scion.foundation/).  

My professional interests revolve around security, cloud computing and networking. Feel free to get in touch!
