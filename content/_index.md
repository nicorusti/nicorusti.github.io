I'm an engineer of several trades based in Switzerland. I am currently working at the [SCION Association](https://scion.org/) and [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I focus on making the Internet more secure and reliable with the [SCION](https://www.scion-architecture.net/) Architecture, on topics as adoption, evangelism and standardization.  

My professional interests revolve around security, cloud computing and networking. Feel free to get in touch!
